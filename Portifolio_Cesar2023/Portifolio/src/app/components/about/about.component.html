                        Hello! My name is <span class="name"><i>Cesar Reis</i></span>, i am from SÃ£o Paulo/Brasil,
                        and I am Founder and CEO of DevCesar.
                        A fan of technology, I started in the programming area from scratch, always
                        aiming for professional and personal growth as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am graduated in Electrician Installation, area in which I worked for a period,
                        but having my heart always in programming, I studied Technician in WEB Development
                        FullStack, course in which I acquired knowledge to further leverage my career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked as a JR Programmer in 2022, where I made some systems with React, being the
                        heart of the company the PLC. I decided to pursue my own career in technology, with
                        some personal and freelance projects.
